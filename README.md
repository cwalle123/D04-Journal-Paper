# D04-Journal-Paper

Hello, this is the new Github repository for the Journal Paper.

The purpose of this new repository is to better organize our scripts without messing
with the previous repository. This is partly due to having too many scripts, but also
as our data stream is now different, we require less/different scripts.

After talking with Siddharth about the syncing issue found a couple weeks back, we decided
on continuing with time synced data that Siddharth had used in his code a few years back.
This means that many of the syncing and files relates to the syncing is no longer needed,
and means that we are continuing with the assumptions that there is no correlation between
different error types.

Right now there are 4 tasks that need to tackled to make our model work:

1. We need to adapt the Excels Siddharth has provided to adhere to our code conventions
2. We need to feed the new experimental data into the 4 statistical models
3. We need to feed the new experimental data into the graphs of the correlation between consective time steps
4. We need to retrain the model on the new experimental data and validate it

This might seem like we need to redo a lot of things, but this isnt true. We already have our
existing code working and these will be copy pasted over from the previous repository within the next 24 hours. All we have to do is make sure that our previous code can handle this new data stream and
regenerate the result figures.

Feel free to join in on any of the tasks. Currently the ones working on them are:
Task 1: Gio
Task 2: Manuel
Task 3: CJ
Task 4: Nobody

If you have any questions, dont hesitate to ask!
