* Data_ALL_importer.py: Ask Siddharth which Tape width columns from the excel files are used for LLSA and LLSB
* Data_ALL_importer.py: Find out why data cut is happening around row 413 for the LLSs instead of later and if that matters
* Data_ALL_importer.py: Find out which Gap column to use from the excel files
* 
* Data_ALL_statistics.py: Check if the functions take in numpy arrays and if not adapt the functions to do so
*

UPDATE: 
The cache files now hold all the relevant data needed for the project in csv files. Calling get_synced_data now
requires tow information and sensor information, see Handling_ALL_Functions.py. This now outputs the data in
NumPy arrays to make the code run more efficiently and to be able to use the data with easier commands.

For those working on the files that need this data as an input, make sure to adapt your functions (can be with gpt ofc)
to take in this new data stream. Note that this data is only time synced which should be fine for all of our applications.
